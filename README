TSME Test Module:
	The TSME test module is a loadable Linux kernel module that can
	be used to determine the state of TSME.

	In order to determine if TSME is active, the SME feature must be
	enabled, but it does not need to be active (the kernel does not
	need to have been booted with mem_encrypt=on).

	The TSME test module will create a sysfs file if no errors are
	encountered while loading the module: /sys/kernel/tsme. If TSME
	is active, the /sys/kernel/tsme file will report 1. If TSME is
	not active, the /sys/kernel/tsme file will report 0.

	To build:
		make

	To install:
		insmod ./tsme-test.ko

	In addition to creating the sysfs file, loading the module will
	generate kernel messages that can also be used to determine the
	status of TSME.
